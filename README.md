# Constructing Parkinson’s disease progression-endotype molecular networks for drug repurposing: multi-omics evidence aggregation and large-scale real-world data validation 
To investigate the molecular drivers of this variability and identify therapeutic opportunities, we conducted a multi-omics, network-based analysis of the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, with independent validation in the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) cohort. By integrating genetic and longitudinal transcriptomic data, we constructed progression-endotype networks, each capturing trait-specific molecular signature. Using these phenotype-informed modules, we applied a network proximity approach to systematically assess 1,595 FDA-approved drugs for repurposing potential. We prioritized 25 candidates, including Zolpidem, Alprazolam, Duloxetine, and Primidone. Analysis of real-world clinical data from two large research networks further revealed consistent associations between use of these drugs and reduced incidence of PD-related outcomes. Together, these findings demonstrate the utility of progression-endotype networks for capturing PD progression biology and guiding drug repurposing. This integrative framework connects molecular mechanisms with clinical impact and may inform precision therapeutic strategies for this neurodegenerative disease.
